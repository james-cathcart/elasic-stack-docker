# Docker Configurations for Elastic Stack

## Overview

This repository contains Dockerfiles, docker-compose files, and configuration files for the various Elastic Stack applications. The intent is to provide myself, and anyone else who is interested, with a simple but functional set of Docker scripts for Elastic Stack research and development.

These scripts are not intended to be comprehensive production setup examples, but rather simple and working environments to get started quickly.
